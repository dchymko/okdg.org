	<h2 class="cufon">Privacy Policy</h2>
	
	<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
	<p>Like most website operators, OKDG collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. OKDG&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how OKDG&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, OKDG may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
	<p>OKDG also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. OKDG does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
	
	<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
	<p>Certain visitors to OKDG’s websites choose to interact with OKDG in ways that require OKDG to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that OKDG gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a profile at okdg.org to provide an email address. OKDG collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with OKDG. OKDG does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
	
	<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
	<p>OKDG may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, OKDG may monitor the most popular profiles on the okdg.org site. OKDG may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, OKDG does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
	
	<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
	<p>OKDG discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on OKDG’s behalf or to provide services available at OKDG’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using OKDG’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. OKDG will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, OKDG discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when OKDG believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of OKDG, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an OKDG website and have supplied your email address, OKDG may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with OKDG and our products. We primarily use our various product profiles to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. OKDG takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
	
	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. OKDG uses cookies to help OKDG identify and track visitors, their usage of OKDG website, and their website access preferences. OKDG visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using OKDG’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of OKDG’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
	
	<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
	<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, OKDG may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in OKDG’s sole discretion. OKDG encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a okdg.org account, you should also check your profile’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
